# SERPENT CIPHER: THE SECOND FINALIST IN AES CONTESTSerpent is a symmetric key block cipher which comes at second place in the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) contest after Rijndael.Serpent has a block size of 128 bits and support a key size of 256 bits. Basically, it is a 32-round permutationsubstitution network which operates on a block of four 32- bit words which is total to 128 bits.### Software Used:C++, ubuntu terminal
